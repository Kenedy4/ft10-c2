## Brief Description of the challenge

    This is a wwebpage with a shopping list. Users can add items to the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

#### Project Requirements and more details

    A. Array:
    ==> Maintain a JavaScript array to store shopping list items.

    B. DOM Manipulation:
    ==> Create an HTML structure with an input field for adding items, a list container to display items, and buttons for "Add", "Mark Purchased", and "Clear List".
    ==> Use JavaScript to dynamically add new items to the list container when the user clicks the "Add" button. (The new items do not have to be persisted once the page refreshes)
    ==> Update the list item visually to indicate purchased items (e.g., strikethrough text, different background color).

    C. Event Handling:
    ==> Attach event listeners to the "Add" button to capture user input and add items to the list.
    ==> Attach event listeners to the list of items to allow users to mark them as purchased.
    ==> Attach an event listener to the "Clear List" button to remove all items from the list.

    D. Bonus Features:
    ==> Allow users to edit existing list items.
    ==> Implement persistence using local storage to save the list even after the page reloads.

## Purpose and Functionality.

    .A customer can  a sitiple list of items.
    .A customer can can clear the ems from the list after enlisting them.
